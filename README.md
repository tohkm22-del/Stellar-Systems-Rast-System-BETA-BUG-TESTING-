# Stellar-Systems-Rast-System-BETA-BUG-TESTING-
Stellar Systems is going to be an interstellar mod, much like Promised Worlds, Kcalbeloh or KSS2.
Stellar Systems is in Beta, and this for BUG TESTING ONLY any bugs should be reported to my Discord server.
Rast System is the first system in my mod. Its an F-type star. 2.7 KLY away [2.7 KLY = 0.027 LY]
